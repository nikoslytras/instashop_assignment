## Hello there, welcome to my solution
**Here you can find information for how to run the server.**

## Instructions
Note that you are gonna need a ``.env`` file in the root folder of the project, you can see the provided ``.env.example`` file (or rename it to .env an use it as is).

To run the services in the root of the folder hit the following commands: 
- ``npm run install``
- ``npm run start_client``
- ``npm run start_parse (In a new terminal)``

***Also you are gonna need an mongo server up and running***

For any questions you can contact with me, thank you very much for your time.
