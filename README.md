## Hello there, welcome to my solution
**Here you can find information for how to run the server.**
**I need to apologize for the delay but the last two weeks was crazy and i a didn't had so much time**

## Instructions
***You are gonna need a mongo server up and running***

Note that before you run the bellow commands you are gonna need a ``.env`` file in the root folder of the project, you can see the provided ``.env.example`` file (or rename it to .env an use it as is).

To run the services in the root of the folder hit the following commands: 
- ``npm run install``
- ``npm run start_client``
- ``npm run start_parse (In a new terminal)``

## When the services are up

- To create, edit and delete a landmark you need to sing up and then login.

For any questions you can contact with me, thank you very much for your time.
